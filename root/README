Here are the root histograms for

* zg, groomed momentum sharing
* rg, groomed jet radius
* z, soft subjet momentum fraction
* theta, subjet angle
* mh, hard subjet mass
* ms, soft subjet mass

in both pp and AA collisions


To make the plots, run the macro in root
$ root -b -q plot_SubJetVars.C+

the -b is for batch mode so that it doesnt try to open up each plot it makes. just makes the code run faster. -q is to quit root after its done with the program. the .C+ makes sure that you compile the code.
